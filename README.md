# Detection-early-stage-Alzgeimer-s-disease-using-fully-connected-Deep-Learning-model.
The goal of this project was to implement novel neural network model to differentiate Early-stage Alzheimer's Disease (ES-AD) and Healthy Controls (HC).

Dataset consists of two partitions:
Partition V3: 

Liste Patients: Database\Software Adquisicion V3_H么pital_Broca\Patients Records_A_All_Broca\PatientList_Diagnostic_A_HC_MCI_AD_test3.txt

Diagnostics : Database\Software Adquisicion V3_H么pital_Broca\Patients Records_A_All_Broca\Diagnostic_A_HC_MCI_AD_test3.txt 

Partition V4: 

Liste Patients : Database\Software acquisition V4_H么pital_Broca\Patients Records - Copie\PatientList_Diagnostic_B_HC_MCI_AD.txt

Diagnostics : Database\Software acquisition V4_H么pital_Broca\Patients Records - Copie\Diagnostic_B_HC_MCI_AD.txt

Each patient did several tasks, like writing free text, given text, drawing sequence of loops and etc. Description of each patient and task is given inside the folder of certain patient.
